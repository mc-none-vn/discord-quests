## <div align="left"><sub><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mc-none-vn/discord-quests/refs/heads/assets/settings.webp" height="30"></sub> How It Works? </div>
```
Every 5 minutes
      ↓
Fetch /quests/@me from Discord API
      ↓
Compare with state.json
      ↓
When a new quest is found → Send a notification using webhook
                          → Ping role (if configured)
                          → Save ID in state.json (atomic write)
When no new quest is found → End
      ↓
Commit state.json to repository
```

## <div align="left"><sub><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mc-none-vn/discord-quests/refs/heads/assets/file.png" height="30"></sub> File state.json </div>
This file is automatically managed by the script. You can:
- **Read**: Directly view it on GitHub.
- **Reset**: Delete all IDs inside `sent_ids` → The bot will resend all currently active quests.
- **Delete 1 quest**: Remove a specific ID from `sent_ids` → The bot will resend only that quest.

**Safety mode:** The script writes data to `state.tmp.json` first, then renames it to `state.json`. If an error occurs while running, `state.json` remains intact and your data is safe.
