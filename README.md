## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Fork and config
> **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

##### In tab Secrets (Click "New repository secret"):

| Secret | Descriptions |
|--------|--------------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | User token Discord |
| `MAIN_WEBHOOK` | URL webhook main notification |
| `ERROR_WEBHOOK` | URL webhook main errors log (it can be empty if you want) |

##### In tab Variables (Click "New repository variable"):

| Variable | Decriptions | value examples |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| `LOCALE` | Language display titles/information of Quest | `vi-VN`, `en-US`, `zh-CN` |
| `PING_ROLE_ID` | ID role Discord you want to ping when it find a quest | fill with ID Role (or empty) |

### 2. Turn on GitHub Actions
> **Actions** → turn on (only if it's off) → test.

## ⚙️ How It Works?

```
Every 5 minutes
      ↓
Fetch /quests/@me from Discord API
      ↓
Compare with state.json
      ↓
When it has found new quest → Send embed using webhook
                            → Ping role (if so)
                            → Save ID in state.json (atomic)
When it hasn't found → End
      ↓
Commit state.json to repo
```

## 📦 File state.json

Those files will be manage by bot. You can:
- **Read**: using GitHub
- **Reset**: delete all `sent_ids` → bot resend all present quest
- **Delete 1 quest**: delete ID out of `sent_ids` → bot resend that quest

**Safety mode:** script write to `state.tmp.json` first, then rename to `state.json`.  
If errors when it's still running → `state.json` still here, datas still fine.
